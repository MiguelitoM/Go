## ðŸŽ¯ Go â€“ The Strategy Game

### Goban  
The **Goban** is a square board used to play Go, typically with dimensions 9Ã—9, 13Ã—13, or 19Ã—19. It consists of **intersections** formed by rows (numbered from 1 to N) and columns (labeled from A to S), where players place their stones.  

### Intersections and Stones  
An **intersection** is defined by its column and row identifiers (e.g., 'C3'). It can be:  
- **empty**,  
- **occupied by a white stone ('O')**,  
- or **occupied by a black stone ('X')**.  

Players alternate turns placing stones on free intersections. Once placed, stones cannot be moved.

### Chains, Liberties and Territories  
- A **chain** is a group of one or more connected stones of the same color.  
- A **liberty** of a stone is any directly adjacent empty intersection. If a stone or a chain loses all its liberties, it is captured and removed from the board.  
- A **territory** is a group of connected empty intersections completely surrounded by stones of a single player.  

### Game Rules  
The game starts with an empty board. The **black player plays first**, and turns alternate. Each turn, a player may:  
- **place a stone**, or  
- **pass** (i.e., skip their turn).  

There are two important restrictions:  
1. **Suicide**: Players cannot place a stone in a way that would immediately remove all liberties of their own stone/chain (unless it results in capturing opponent stones).  
2. **Repetition (Ko rule)**: A move that would recreate a previous board state is illegal.

The game ends when both players pass consecutively.  

### Objective of the Project  
The goal of this programming project is to **implement a playable version of Go** in Python. Students must define appropriate **abstract data types** (ADTs) for stones, intersections, and the Goban, and implement the rules and mechanisms for:  
- stone placement and capture,  
- chain identification,  
- territory evaluation,  
- and final scoring.  

The project culminates with a function that enables **two players to play a full match of Go** on a configurable board size.
